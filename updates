				<h4>Trust Score</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						Score scores are a new way to view how active and how trusted a player within our community is. Trust score ranges from 0 - 100 percent. When a new player joins our community their trust score starts at 75% and will gain 1% every hour of playtime on any of our servers. If a player is warned their trust score goes down by 1%, if kicked 3% and if banned 6%. 
					</li>

						The orange "Kick For Staff" button on a servers page will kick the most recent connected player to allow for a staff member to join the server. This kick does not count against their record.
