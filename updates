				<h4>Permissions</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						The permissions system has been released. The current permissions used by the system are warn, kick, ban, editstaff and editservers. More will be coming in the future such as unban, permban, tempban, etc.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Discord Webhooks</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						We've finished the Discord webhook system. This will allow you to have a Discord chat that will message every time someone gets warned, kicked, or banned.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Join Message</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						Join messages are now supported. The default join message is "Username is joining the server with 75% trust score." This message by default won't look the best because the default chat resource already provides join messages and puts <b>server:</b> infront of our messages. This is an easy fix. Join our Discord for help.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Edit Staff</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						You're now able to add and remove staff from a menu! If you have the "editstaff" permission you can click the Edit Staff button on the left side of the screen and explore the menu.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Edit Servers</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						You're now able to add and remove servers from a menu! If you have the "editservers" permission you can click the Edit Servers button on the left side of the screen and explore the menu.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Installer Changes</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						Sadly we've had to remove the installer as it was too unreliable and had too many expoits.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						We've squashed a lot of bugs. Many bugs centered around errors and timeouts. We can't thank the beta testers enough for helping us find these.
					</li>
				</ul>
