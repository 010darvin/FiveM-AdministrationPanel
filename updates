				<h4>Plugin System</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						We're glad to announce that we've release a plugin system. To find plugins developed by the team visit <a href="https://github.com/CADOJRP/FiveM-AdministrationPanel-Plugins">https://github.com/CADOJRP/FiveM-AdministrationPanel-Plugins</a>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Chat Commands</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						You're now able to warn, kick, and ban using in-game commands. Running the command will check the users permissions before taking action.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Removing Records</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						We have finally added the ability for staff to remove warns, kicks and bans from a players profile.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Back End Stuff</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						We're continuing to work hard to improve our panel. With the new Plugins System we will start focusing on other unique features such as vRP and ESX support. 
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Analytics</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						In the recent updates we've been working to add tracking to our software. The reason for this is it allows us to access your GET API Endpoints and we're able to use that information to make plugins such as a Global Ban, global time tracking, records on other servers, etc. To disable panel tracking change "analytics" to false in your config file.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						We've squashed a lot of bugs. Many bugs centered around errors and timeouts. We can't thank the beta testers enough for helping us find these.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Permissions</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						The permissions system has been released. The current permissions used by the system are warn, kick, ban, editstaff and editservers. More will be coming in the future such as unban, permban, tempban, etc.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Discord Webhooks</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						We've finished the Discord webhook system. This will allow you to have a Discord chat that will message every time someone gets warned, kicked, or banned.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Join Message</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						Join messages are now supported. The default join message is "Username is joining the server with 75% trust score." This message by default won't look the best because the default chat resource already provides join messages and puts <b>server:</b> infront of our messages. This is an easy fix. Join our Discord for help.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Edit Staff</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						You're now able to add and remove staff from a menu! If you have the "editstaff" permission you can click the Edit Staff button on the left side of the screen and explore the menu.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Edit Servers</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						You're now able to add and remove servers from a menu! If you have the "editservers" permission you can click the Edit Servers button on the left side of the screen and explore the menu.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Installer Changes</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						Sadly we've had to remove the installer as it was too unreliable and had too many expoits.
					</li>
				</ul>
