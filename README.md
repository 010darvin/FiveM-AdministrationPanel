### Recommended Hosting
* Cloud Version at <a href="https://fivemadminpanel.com">https://FiveMAdminPanel.com</a> (Free)
* https://ELHostingServices.com offers $1.50 one-time payment web hosting that meets all of our requirements. (This is the hosting that we use while developing). From my personal experience working at ELHS for over a year I can personally say that they do not throttle or give priority to monthly hosting verses one-time; however they do limit you on certain resources such as MySQL databases, bandwidth, and storage.
